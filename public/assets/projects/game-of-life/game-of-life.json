This interested me however, because this simple simulation is Turing complete, meaning that it can simulate anything that a typical computer can (even being able to simulate the game within itself). I built this as a way to familiarize myself with the game, and also have a way to mess around and try some things. <br><br> It's linked above, so anyone can play around with it!"
