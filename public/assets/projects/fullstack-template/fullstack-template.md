# Overview

While working on developing fullstack applications, I found that often I was redoing the same work over and over again, to setup user authentication, integrating react, and implementing JWT Tokens. To solve this, I did this all once and created an effective boilerplate for anyone to use.

# Technical

A react frontend is integrated with django, to build the fullstack app. The most important part however is the JWT tokens, for user authentication. It stands for JSON Web Token, and it is a token stored on the frontend to validate requests. Using this is very helpful as it streamlines the process of using the REST API.
