I am part of teams that have to send many emails to supporters, sponsors, etc, and the emails are basically the same. The problem is that it looks very unprofessional to send an email with no addressee at the top, and to CC people. This is something I can solve."

Then, setup a file with the emails, and corresponding variables, and that's it. I may look at developing this into a fullstack app with a frontend, but for now it suits my needs.",
