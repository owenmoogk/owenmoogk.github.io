			"text": "I was looking at different types of algorithms in python and javascript, and wanted to make a visualizer to show how they work. I started in pygame, and made a pathfinding visualizer. It is pretty cool, and works well. It can use lots of different searching techniques. I had to do a lot of googling for A*, but I also implemented Dijkstra's Algorithm and Greedy Best First Search."

			"title": "Inspiration",
			"text": "Pathfinding algorithms always fascinated me, and they are also super useful. I'm working on learning about graphs and other advanced data structures, and this essentially implements that. It is also a must know for software development roles/jobs, so I wanted to get it under my belt."
