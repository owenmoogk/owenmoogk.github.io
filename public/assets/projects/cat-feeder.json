			"text": "Me and my good friend Janik made a automated machine to assist with feeding cats. This was designed for a the <a href='https://jamhacks.ca/'>JamhacksV</a> hackathon. Although I don't own a cat, Janik does, and as a very busy person he doesn't always have the time. Through 3D printing, engineering, an arduino, and some code (written in python and C++), the Cat Feeder was born. <br><br> This was the most fun I've had working on a project in a while, and we ended up winning the prize for the best hardware hack. <br><br> For technical information, we have a website currently up <a href='https://owenmoogk.github.io/cat-feeder-website'>here</a>, and the Github page is linked at the top."

			"text": "This machine uses an arduino with a bit of C++ code that Janik wrote. I worked on the image detection, written in Python. I attempted many things, such as training my own HAAR cascade model, but ended up just going with a model that I found online. The machine has 3 preset 'feeding times', in which the live feed will run and look for cats. After a cat has been found, it sends a signal to the arduino to move a servo and open the feeding door."
