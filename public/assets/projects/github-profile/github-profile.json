I realize that many other people have created pages for Github data, but this also includes Github Cards, and Corners to show off a repository in HTML. You can view any repository's contribution data (who has made the most commits, etc), as well as any user and their stats. <br><br> The last thing that I added that was cool was an option to input an API key. I have seen a few other websites, but they are capped at the 60 request limit Github imposes, which can get quite limited. I have a few API keys active, as many others do I'm sure, so the key can just be inputted and it will save in localstorage. Now we have 5000 requests! <br><br> Both the website and Github page are linked above."
