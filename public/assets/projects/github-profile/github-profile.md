# Overview

I had recently discovered the GitHub API, and as a avid GitHub user I wanted to have a nice hub for my data. I realize that many other people have created pages for GitHub data, but this also includes GitHub Cards, and Corners to show off a repository in HTML. You can view any repository's contribution data (who has made the most commits, etc), as well as any user and their stats.

The last thing that I added that was cool was an option to input an API key. I have seen a few other websites, but they are capped at the 60 request limit GitHub imposes, which can get quite limited. I have a few API keys active, as many others do I'm sure, so the key can just be inputted and it will save in localstorage. Now we have 5000 requests!

Both the website and GitHub page are linked above.

# Why?
Obviously, this is all readily available on the GitHub website. However, I kind of like using an API that allows for a custom user interface and experience, that may be a bit different. Also, it's more focused on crunching stats (like language usage and contributions).

It provides an "at a glance" of what languages were used, and who worked on what.

Also, I liked that I could make a page where images and HTML could be easily downloaded for users, which is much more accessible than it is on GitHub.
