It's a fun project made in pygame with python, using Matplotlib for some graphing. It is a quick and dirty project that I made while bored in CS class. All the code is on Github if you want to check it out. <br><br>Next steps for this might be operating in true human units, as I just used some arbitrary number (based off of pixels), so everything is relative to each other."
