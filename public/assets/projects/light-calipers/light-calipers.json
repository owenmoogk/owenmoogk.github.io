			"text": "For my statistics class, myself and my peers were tasked with creating a custom measurement system (without using any COTS components that could do so). We decided to make a caliper-type device that could measure distance, using and LED and a photoresistor. The principles of operation are fairly simple, the light intensity dissipates at further distance, which can be converted into a distance."

Our group created a report detailing this process that can be found <a href='/assets/projects/light-calipers/report.pdf'>here</a>."
