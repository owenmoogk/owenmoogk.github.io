# Overview
As part of my involvement with Wrmth, I developed multiple devices to support a wide range of product lines, including heated outdoor furniture and modular lighting solutions, all internet connected via both Wifi and Bluetooth.

## Technical Specifications
Each board has it's own technical specification, however some examples of supported devices include:
- 24v power delivery, controllable with PWM
- Programmable RGBW lighting zones
- Analog sensor input
- Digital sensor input
- Safety watchdog
- External power connectors
- Power over USB-C
