It is implemented with python and pygame, and it works pretty well at the moment. One thing that I would really like to try is to allow them to move about the screen, giving an added layer."

			"text": "Fireflies have a property in which they observe other fireflies around them, and blink according to what they see (a firefly is a bug that can illuminate itself). Based on what others are doing around them they adjust their timing to be more like the group. Over only a few seconds small interactions between fireflies create large chains and synchronizations. If you have ever seen them in nature, they all seem to blink at once, and this is why."
