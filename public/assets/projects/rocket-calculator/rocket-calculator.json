			"text": "After creating my model rocket, I was interested in the probable apogee that I had achieved. I ended up doing quite a bit of math to solve this, however it only used a few inputs, such as the mass, thrust, and burn time. To solve for this, I created this for other people to use to simulate the results of a flight. Check it out <a href='https://owenmoogk.github.io/rocket-calculator' target='_blank'>here</a>."
