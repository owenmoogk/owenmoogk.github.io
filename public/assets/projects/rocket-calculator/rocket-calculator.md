# Overview

After creating my model rocket, I was interested in the probable apogee that I had achieved. I ended up doing quite a bit of math to solve this, however it only used a few inputs, such as the mass, thrust, and burn time. To solve for this, I created a calculator for other people to use, to simulate the results of a flight. It's linked above, so feel free to check it out!

Note: It does neglect air friction/resistance and makes a few assumptions, so it's a good ballpark but not super precise.
