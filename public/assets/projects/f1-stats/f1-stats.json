Using this information, I calculated highest and lowest possible positions, as well as if the championship was still in reach. <br><br> It can also be seen above (or on the website), that there is a column for \"Winnable on Performance\". This column shows whether or not the driver will win if they perform to the maximum. This is interesting because although some drivers can still win the championship, winning every remaining race won't guarantee it."
