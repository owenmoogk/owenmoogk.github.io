			"text": "Mecanum wheels are super cool as the wheels have rollers on them, angled at 45 degrees. Mine are all 3D printed, but have the same operation of this picture below. This leads to a diagonal force being exerted, and spinning creates multiple different possibilities when associated with other wheels.",
