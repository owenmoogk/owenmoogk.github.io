I know there are a few (many) others on the internet but they are populated with ads and really annoying to use so this does have a practical purpose for me. I also know of a few other people who use this, so it feels really good to make something that has an impact, no matter the size."

			"text": "This was designed using the javascript canvas, so there is no external library used. Looking back, the code could probably be made a bit cleaner with more research of image manipulating techniques, but I was very proud of it. <br><br> I have implemented CSV support for downloading pixel data, as well as picking colors and getting the average color of an image. There is also functionality to turn the image into greyscale. Definitely a fun project to work on."
