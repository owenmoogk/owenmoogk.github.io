# Overview

This is less of a project but more a collection of them, that I felt I should talk about them somewhere. I have been working a lot to learn CSS, JS, and React. I have made a lot of personal portfolio websites to practice and learn and have made a lot of progress over the last year.

I recently made this website as a place to tell a little bit about me, show off some of my projects, and to have a "one stop shop" for all my files that people might find useful. It was totally a fun project, as I made 8 versions (not all fully complete, but that's a lot!). It's great as it can also showcase some other coding endeavours, like my Sudoku Algorithm or Sorting Visualizer. If you have any suggestions about this website or anything else, please feel free to [contact me](/contact).

Also, for anyone interested, old versions of my personal websites are located on this same domain, with an additional version code (eg. [owenmoogk.github.io/v6](https://owenmoogk.github.io/v6) for version 6).
