# Overview

I have recently been doing renders and graphical design with [Solidworks](https://www.solidworks.com) and [Blender](https://www.blender.org). Some of my renders include sticky notes, donuts (which I am particularly proud of), and futuristic cell phones (not shown here). All the source files and some more renders are on Github, so feel free to have a look.
