# Overview

Sticky Caps is an amazingly simple python script that I always keep running in the background on my computer. Maybe not the most mature of creations, but a great showing of how simple and effective python is. Sticky Caps modifies the keyboard to allow for sarcasm case: "WhIcH lOoKs A bIt LiKe ThIS". It was always a pain to keep pressing shift or caps when expressing sarcasm in messaging apps like discord, so hitting [alt+i] will toggle this. If you are interested in using this the installer is on GitHub, linked above.
