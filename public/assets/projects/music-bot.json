			"text": "Over the past few weeks I have developed a music bot application, following along with some YouTube videos. It allows users on local networks (and can also be hosted on a server) to control music playback as a group. Uses include communal speakers and parties, where the mass of people can control the music."
		},
		{
			"title": "Technical",
			"text": "It was great to integrate React and Django into one project. It was my first time doing it, and with some Material UI components it was off to the races.It uses the <a href='https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/'>Spotify API</a>, and is designed to be run locally. I usually run it on my computer so anyone on my network can use it, but I may consider running it on a server in the future."

			"title": "Usage",
			"text": "This app allows users to host rooms, and let anyone else join the app and have say in the playback of music. It uses room codes to join rooms similar to Kahoot or Google Classroom, and once joined the users have control of music playback as much as the host wants.",
