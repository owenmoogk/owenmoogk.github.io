			"text": "This is just a python script reading the screen. It uses PIL to take a screenshot of the screen, and then uses OpenCV to read the screenshot. Lastly, it uses PyTesseract to recognize the part of the screen displaying the text, and converts it to a string. From this, we parse the string accordingly and use the Pynput module to simulate keystrokes."
