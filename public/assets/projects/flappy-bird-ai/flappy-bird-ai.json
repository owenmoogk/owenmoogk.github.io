			"text": "This project uses the <a href='https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/neat_overview.html'>NEAT</a> library in python. It really interests me and I find it quite fascinating. I decided to create a flappy bird game when I saw a YouTube video from <a href='https://youtube.com/techwithtim'>TechWithTim</a>, so I used that as an assistance when needed but wrote most of the code myself."

			"text": "This project was my first introduction to neural networks. The python NEAT library does a lot of the heavy lifting for me, but was a great introduction to the basics. It was helpful to have a tutorial to look at when working on something completely new, but I was weary of copying things line for line as it's not a good way to learn. I will be looking at doing something of my own with the NEAT library soon, so look out :)"
