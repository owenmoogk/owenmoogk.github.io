                        Hey there! My name is Owen Moogk and this is my website!
                        I am currently a highschool student at <a href="https://bci.wrdsb.ca" class="blinks" target="_blank">Bluevale Collegiate Institute</a>, 
                        and I am quite passionate about engineering, coding, and design. 
                        I am also a student on the FRC robotics team <a href="https://2702rebels.com" class="blinks" target="_blank">2702 Rebels</a> in which I build competitive robots.
                    </p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="text">
                    <p>
                        Like I said, I enjoy doing lots with engineering.
                        Take a look at my 
                        <a href="projects.html" class="blinks">projects</a>
                        page for more details of what I have been working on,
                        including taking apart and rebuilding a small engine, building websites, using CAD software to make parts,
                        3D printing, and much more.
                    </p>

                <div class="text">
                    Outside of school and robotics, I also am in many extracurricular programs including
                    being a participant in the 
                    <a href="https://dukeofed.org" class="blinks" target="_blank">Duke of Edinburgh's Award</a> pushing involvement in the community and building as a person upon young adults. 
                    I was also accepted into 
                    <a href="https://shad.ca" class="blinks" target="_blank">Shad Canada</a>, a prestegious one month camp dedicated to innovating and learning.
                    I am a part of Bluevale Collegiate's 
                    <a href="https://bci.wrdsb.ca/choose-to-lead/" class="blinks" target="_blank">Choose To Lead</a> program, which is a leadership based learning environment for students with leadership skills and potential.
