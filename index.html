                    Hey. It's Owen. This is my website I made to work on my web developement skills.
                    I am currently a highschool student at <a href="https://bci.wrdsb.ca" class="bluelinks" target="_blank">Bluevale Collegiate Institute</a>, 
                    and I am quite passionate about engineering, coding, and design. 
                    I am also a student on the FRC robotics team <a href="https://2702rebels.com" class="bluelinks" target="_blank">2702 Rebels</a> in which I build competitive robots.
                    I am currently employed at
                    <a href="https://merryhillgolf.com" class="bluelinks" target="_blank">Merry Hill Golf Club</a>.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                <p>
                    Like I said, I enjoy doing lots with engineering.
                    Take a look at my 
                    <a href="projects.html" class="bluelinks">projects</a>
                    page for more details of what I have been working on,
                    such as building a small engine from components, building websites, using CAD software,
                    3D printing, and much more.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                <p>
                    Outside of school and robotics, I also am in many extracurricular programs including
                    being a participant in the 
                    <a href="https://dukeofed.org" class="bluelinks" target="_blank">Duke of Edinburgh's Award</a> pushing involvement in the community and building as a person upon young adults. 
                    I was also accepted into 
                    <a href="https://shad.ca" class="bluelinks" target="_blank">Shad Canada</a>, a prestegious one month camp dedicated to innovating and learning.
                    I am a part of Bluevale Collegiate's 
                    <a href="https://bci.wrdsb.ca/choose-to-lead/" class="bluelinks" target="_blank">Choose To Lead</a> program, which is a leadership based learning environment for students with leadership skills and potential.
                    For more information take a look at my <a href="work.html" class="bluelinks">Work/Extracurriculars</a> page.
