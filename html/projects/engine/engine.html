                    Overview
                </h1>
                <p>
                    I recently took on the project of building a small engine to learn about
                    the inner functions and gain mechanical skills. I stripped it down to its bare components, and then rebuilt it all from scratch.
                    Not only was it a great experience of learning mechanical skills, but I also learned about the functions of the engine and how it all comes together
                    to do it's job. 
                    <br><br>
                    Through the project, I took a few images that are shown below.
                    This was a really fun project, and I learned way more about how a 4-stroke combustion engine works.
