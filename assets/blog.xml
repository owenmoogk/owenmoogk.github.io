        <title>Website Updates</title>

            So been working on my website this weekend and just pushed this to my website. It all looks pretty good :)
            ~~~~
            The homepage might need some work, but that's a problem for another time. My website is now more Javascript than anything else according to Github,
            which is what I was going for as I wanted the most of it to be really easy to edit with XML files and all the HTML be handled by JS.

        <date>November 24, 2020</date>
        <text>I've been messing around with my printer the last few days, and have made a lot of progress. It took about 10 hours to build and level the bed, 
        but now I've got it going really smoothly and have been running prints non-stop that I have been planning for the last while. Most of those files are 
        on my github.</text>

        <title>Model Rocket</title>
        <date>November 20, 2020</date>
        <text>Well. I'm printing my first model of the rocket I'm building. My tech design teacher let me use his printer, so
        I'm excited to launch that soon. I'm going to try launching it with an A class engine, just to see the height, and then
        I may go out and get a C class engine depending on how high it goes off the bat. My friend is giving me a few rocket engines
        to mess around with and text. Hopefully I can have it in the air by next week.</text>

        <title>Websites</title>
        <date>November 19, 2020</date>
        <text>Websites. So rewarding. And a pain in the ass. I have probably spent 40 hours on my website version 3,
        and i just decided I really don't like it. Look at it. It's ugly. So I am resorting to a similar layout of
        my website version 2. Hopefully I can take everything I've learned and use it to make this one actually good.</text>
