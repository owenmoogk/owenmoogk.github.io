        <title>Model Rocket</title>
        <date>November 20, 2020</date>
        <text>Well. I'm printing my first model of the rocket I'm building. My tech design teacher let me use his printer, so
        I'm excited to launch that soon. I'm going to try launching it with an A class engine, just to see the height, and then
        I may go out and get a C class engine depending on how high it goes off the bat. My friend is giving me a few rocket engines
        to mess around with and text. Hopefully I can have it in the air by next week.</text>

        <title>Websites</title>
        <date>November 19, 2020</date>
        <text>Websites. So rewarding. And a pain in the ass. I have probably spent 40 hours on my website version 3,
        and i just decided I really don't like it. Look at it. It's ugly. So I am resorting to a similar layout of
        my website version 2. Hopefully I can take everything I've learned and use it to make this one actually good.</text>
