        <title>Overview</title>
        <text>I am a part of the <a href="https://2702rebels.com" class="blinks" target="_blank">2702 Rebels</a> FIRST Robotics team,
            and we just finished our 2019 robot, named Roadrunner! It was designed to compete in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mew6G_og-PI" class="blinks" target="_blank">2019 Destination Deep Space</a>
            FIRST robotics competition. This page takes an in depth look into our robot, with some of the specs and competition numbers.
            Overall, I am super proud of this robot, as we qualified for the Detroit World Championships!
            Check it out in action in our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg6R_3o6a9M" class="blinks" target="_blank">reveal video</a> (which is also linked at the bottom).</text>
